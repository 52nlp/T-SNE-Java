T-SNE-Java
==========


Pure Java implementation of Van Der Maaten and Hinton's t-sne clustering algorithm.

This project has been refacored into two separate Maven projects, one for the core tsne and one for the demos.

This is still a "development" version, i.e it is currently not too useful as a stand alone tool.

To see graps generated with this implementation, [Klick here](http://lejon.github.io/TSneJava/)

Enjoy!
