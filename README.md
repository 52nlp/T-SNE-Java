T-SNE-Java
==========


Pure Java implementation of Van Der Maaten and Hinton's t-sne clustering algorithm.

This is a simple port of the Python version of T-SNE.
Lots of room for improvement mostly in terms of speed.
The goal with this version is ease of understanding, simplicity and as stand alone as possible.
